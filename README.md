just another repository

Hi Git users,

I'm a new user of this platform and wanting to know more about git application. I'm a Computer Engineering by professional and currently work as Software Engineer with Syntel, Inc for Boston, MA branch. I'm the bench waiting to take on a project from our Client (State Street). Hence, I take this moment to learn Github and get ready to use it whenever required.
